# 
# 
# 

# This book was started in the Fall of 2021 at [East Central University](https://ecok.edu) for a course on Operations Research (CPSMA 3933).  All material here was created by the students and faculty member in hopes to create an OER (**O**pen **E**ducational **R**esource) for use in future classes.

# ## Python

# Python was utilized throughout the text and some familiarity will be nesseccary for the reader to follow.  Many packages were included as the open source community has many pre-built solutions for python.
# 
# 
# 
# 

# ## Resources 

# 
# 
# Chapters were created with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.  Much of the computing was done on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and many direct links on the notebooks will take you there with the chapters directly.  The book was compiled with [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).  The source code for the entire project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/nurfnick/Operations_Research).
